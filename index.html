                <img class="image" src="basic-homeless.png" alt="Basic information about homelessness">
                <h3>Statistics</h3>
                <p>There are not many statistics about homeless people. In England there were over 219,000
                    homeless people in 2019. In 2016, 1 in 1,670 Americans were experiencing homelessness. Homeless people face
                    many more challanges in life when compared to people with adequate housing conditions. For example they are 17 times
                    more
                    likely to be victims of violence.
                    They are also 9 times more likely to take their own life. People who are homeless usually die in
                    their
                    40s-on average 45 for men and 43 for women.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Homelessness</h3>
                <h4>Rough Sleeping</h4>
                <img class="image" src="rough-sleeping.jpg" alt="Rough sleeping">
                <p>
                    Rough sleeping is when a homeless person has to sleep outside on the streets.
                    This is the most well known and most dangerous form of homelessness. When you think of homelessness, rough sleeping
                    is
                    usually what you would think of.
                    People who rough sleep tend to face severe forms of trauma, mental health and drug issues the
                    longer they rough sleep. 
                </p>
                <h4>Statutory Homelessness</h4>
                <img class="image" src="statutory-homeless.jpg" alt="Statutory homelessness">
                <p>
                    Statutory homelessness is a state of homelessness in which the person is protected by the
                    authorities
                    and they secure a home for them. However, to be registered for this care you have to meet several
                    criteria. People who meet these criteria will be provided with accommodations - for example families
                    with children. 
                </p>
                <h4>Hidden Homelessness</h4>
                <img class="image" src="hidden-homeless.jpg" alt="Hidden homelessness">
                <p>
                    Hidden homelessness is when the person in question does not contact the authorities about their
                    situation. This makes them unable to get certain potential help from the government. Many of these
                    people sleep in hotels, squats, b&bs or in the homes of friends or family. 
                </p>
                <h4>At Risk of Homelessness</h4>
                <img class="image" src="atrisk-homeless.jpg" alt="At risk of homelessness">
                <p>
                    These people are people who have a higher chance of becoming homeless. There are many people at risk
                    of
                    becoming homeless due to reasons such as job loss or low pay. It is important that we help these
                    individuals. Afterall, that might be us in a few years and when we would experience it we would want
                    others to help us.
                </p>
                <h2 id="how-homeless">How do People Become Homeless?</h2>
                <p>Most often the reasons for becoming homeless are out of control for the individual. (Tier 4 ‘a
                    devastating blow’ for Big Issue sellers on the biggest week of the year) There are many things that
                    can
                    push someone into homelessness. These can be personal problems but also social problems.
                </p>
                <h4>Social</h4>
                <p>Social causes are caused by society, and social issues. These include lack of
                    affordable housing, severe poverty, unemployment, lack of qualifications,
                    family
                    background issues or previous experience of homelessness in the family. (Tier 4 ‘a devastating blow’
                    for
                    Big Issue sellers on biggest week of the year)

                </div>
                <h4>Other</h4>
                <p>Other problems that lead someone to homelessness are leaving somewhere and not having a place to return to 
                    to
                    for example the army, prison, care, the hospital or leaving a violent/abusive relationship - usually
                    for
                    women. Another reason for someone to be homeless is simply not being able to afford rent. People
                    also
                    become homeless due to big life events. These include breaking down relationships, losing a job or 
                    health problems which can be physical and or mental. However, in almost all cases homelessness can
                    be
                    prevented.

                <h4>Interviews</h4>
                <p>
                    Jill Cowan and Marie Tae McDermott conducted an interview with homeless people to find out why
                    these
                    people are homeless. They got dozens of responses. A lot of the responses referred to injury, job
                    loss,
                    domestic violence, mental illness and addiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a 2019 survey 26 percent of the interviewees stated that job loss was the primary cause of their
                    homelessness. 18 percent stated that it was drugs or alcohol, 13 percent stated that it was eviction
                    and
                    8 percent stated that the primary cause of their homelessness was by their mental illness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many African Americans are often pushed into homelessness because of institutionalized racism. This
                    causes many African Americans to be homeless due to something that is out of their control.
                </p>

                <h2 id="how-help">Practical Ways You Can Help the Homeless</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of ways to help people without a home. The most common one is to give them money on the
                    streets. But is this really the best option? What can we do instead?
                </p>
                <h4>Care  Packages</h4>
                <p>A care package is a very useful thing for homeless people. In the care package you can
                    include
                    anything. Food, clothes or other useful items such as hand wipes, deodorant, socks etc. Because care packages 
                    can be
                    very
                    useful, we made a section on how to make the care package.
                    <li><a href="#what-package">What Should You Include in a Care Package</a></li>
                </p>
                <h4>Educate Yourself</h4>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of reasons why people become homeless. For example, lack of affordable housing,
                    loss of
                    employment, divorce, illness, substance abuse, domestic abuse and more. This can be a first step
                    towards helping the homeless people. You should educate yourself why people become homeless. Because
                    if
                    you want to help you need to know the possibilities of how they got into this position.
                </p>
                <h4>Teach</h4>
                <p>
                    When you educate yourself enough you can organize classes with people experiencing homelessness
                    through
                    your local shelter to teach typing, accounting, plumbing, carpentry, child care, nutrition or even a
                    new
                    language. Those skills can help a homeless person find work in the future.
                </p>
                <h4>Donate</h4>
                <p>
                    Donating means a lot to the homeless people, you can donate clothes, shoes, food and many other items. 
                    People experiencing homelessness
                    will
                    appreciate this help. Some shelters may have a problem with not having enough food to feed everyone.
                    Additionally,
                    when it is cold during the winter season people experiencing homelessness will be so thankful for warm
                    clothes, blankets, that can keep them warm. Donate new or
                    gently used clothes. We need to show them some respect too. So, shelters will appreciate personal hygiene on clothing
                    items and socks.
                </p>
                <h4>Volunteer</h4> 
                <p>
                    Another good thing you can do is to sign up to work at your local homeless shelter. It can be an
                    evening
                    shift or a shift during the Christmas holidays. Where you answer phones, sort mail, serve food,
                    wash
                    dishes, distribute clothes, babysit kids, clean floors, or fix things that are not working.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Seek For Job Opportunities</h4>
                <p>
                    This may be one of the most beneficial options, because you help people experiencing homelessness integrate back 
                    into society. As many people experiencing homelessness cannot find regular employment. 
                    So, energize your church or community center to enlist a homeless person to paint, clean, type, answer
                    telephones etc. It does not necessarily need to be in a church or a community center, you can help
                    people
                    experiencing homelessness find any type of job that they will be able to do. 
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    It might also be beneficial 
                    if you help a homeless person obtain pesonal documents such as an ID card,
                    since many homeless people lack important documents. This prevents them from being able to apply for a job position
                    or recieve proper medical attention. 
                </p>
                <h2 id="covid19-effects">The Impact of COVID-19 on the Homeless</h2>
                <p>
                    Homeless people should be our priority because they are at a
                     bigger risk of getting infected by COVID-19 and need our help
                      during these difficult times. People experiencing homelessness 
                      may be at bigger risk for getting infected by COVID-19. This 
                      causes the fact that they live outside. The absence of accommodation 
                      has a bad effect on the results of physical and mental health, in connection 
                      with the transmission and spread of COVID-19. Coronavirus the dangers related 
                      with living outside or in a camp setting are
                     not the same as from remaining inside, for example, a crisis 
                     cover or other assembled living office.
                     <br>
                     Outdoor life can allow individuals to increase the real distance among 
                     themselves as well as between other people. In any case, when regularly 
                     being outisde does not provide climate insurance, sufficient access to 
                     offices for cleanliness and sterilization, or contact with the administration 
                     and medical services. The balance of danger to the homeless should be taken 
                     into account for any individual who encounters untouched ‘vagrancy‘. 
                     <br>
                     When very first cases of coronavirus arrived then new cases of homelessness have been reported. 
                     An expansion in homelessness has been distinguished, they will also require comfort due to the 
                     state of emergency. Problems such as homelessness of young people, increased frequency of ill-
                     treatment of domestic people, release from the clinic and release from prison are likely to prove 
                     more complicated. It is 
                     equally important for the exclusion of individuals who have recently become poor as a result of 
                     COVID-19.
                     <br>
                     The situation with the newest virus ‘COVID-19‘ is getting worse. 
                     Homeless people need our help. They are in the biggest danger. 
                     We should act with more kindness, respect and compassion 
                     towards the homeless people. Keep in mind that there are many

                    you don’t have the resources to help the homeless personally, you can consider supporting the
                    organizations below. You can support these charities in multiple forms, whether in the form of
                    volunteering, donating (items or finances) or by spreading awareness on the homelessness crisis.
                    You
                    can also help by donating or volunteering at your local homeless shelter.

                <p>
                    Care packages or care kits as they are also known are a very simple and easily achievable form of
                    helping
                    the homeless in your community. Acts of kindness can make a large impact on a person in need and
                    remember you do not have to do everything alone, you can involve your co-workers, friends,
                    classmates,
                    and family to help you create these small acts of kindness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When packing a care kit, pack all items in a reusable easy to carry bags, backpacks, or a zip lock
                    bags
                    so that they can be easily stored since homeless men and women often do not have resources to store
                    these products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After you
                    finish packaging these care kits you can deliver them to your local homeless shelter, local
                    volunteer
                    group or organization that helps the homeless or you can distribute them personally to people in
                    need.
                    If you do not have resources to create gift packages you can also donate these items to your local
                    shelter or organization which works with the homeless.
